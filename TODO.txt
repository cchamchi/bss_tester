DONE:

A weighting function - now really done
compute something like a spectrogram from a wav file

apply a_weighting to spectrograms

IN PROGRESS

detect speech intervals 

TODO:

compute gain values

amplify speech and noise to a standardized amplitude (actually not important because in ASR it will be normalized)
- should avoid or intentionally radnomize this to train the network to be robust to signal level differences

mix at the specified SNR - compute the speech-to-noise ratio using spectrograms and a-weighting,
and then just mix the signals with a certain amplitude

OPTIONAL:

Do something fancy for multichannel signals. (we want to use mono signals, stereo in the best case)

NOTE:

brutal idea - mine speech samples from online audio books, and automatically
generate short audio segments with approximate transcripts 

once done, try out currennt
